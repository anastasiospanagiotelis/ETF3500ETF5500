# Why?



---
# Why vectors and matrices?

- Nearly all the methods we cover involve *vectors* and *matrices*.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- The earlier lecture on matrices may have felt like it involved remembering many seemingly arbitrary rules.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- The aim of this lecture is to understand the *geometric* interpretation of vectors which is crucial in making the connection between data, data analysis and visualisation.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Matrices are important to gain a deep understanding about dimension reduction.

---

# Vectors

- We will think of a 2-dimensional vector in one of three ways:&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + A point in 2-dimensional space&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + An arrow pointing to that point in 2-dimensional space&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + An array of 2 numbers&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- All of these ideas work for n-dimensional vectors where n can be 3,4 or any number
--

- By convention all vectors in this lecture are column vectors.

---

# Vectors as numbers

In general a vector is:

`$${\mathbf{v}}=\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}$$`

For our two examples.

`$${\mathbf{v}}_1=\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}\quad\mbox{and}\quad{\mathbf{v}}_2=\begin{bmatrix}3\\1\end{bmatrix}$$`

---

# Data as a vector

- Consider two examples:&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + The vector `\(\bf{v}\)` corresponds to a cage where `\(x\)` measures the number of chickens and `\(y\)` measures the number of rabbits.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + The vector `\(\bf{v}\)` corresponds to a country where `\(x\)` measures the trade deficit in 2016 and `\(y\)` measures trade deficit in 2017.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Notice that if we have many cages or countries and plot each of these vectors as points we get a scatterplot

---

# Vector Operations

- There are two fundamental *operations* that we can do with vectors&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + Vector *addition*&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + Scalar *multiplication*&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- We will look at each of these: &lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + Geometrically (with pictures) and &lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + Algebraically (with numbers)

---

  
# Vector Addition: Geometry
  
- The operation of adding two vectors is simply to slide one along the other.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- This is called *translation*&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- The order of adding vectors does not matter `\(\mathbf{v}_1+\mathbf{v}_2=\mathbf{v}_2+\mathbf{v}_1\)`&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- This property is called *commutativity*

# Vector Additions: Numbers
  
Vector addition is as simple as adding up the corresponding numbers

`$$\begin{bmatrix}\color{red}{1}\\\color{black}{2}\end{bmatrix}+
  \begin{bmatrix}\color{red}{3}\\\color{black}{1}\end{bmatrix}=
  \begin{bmatrix}\color{red}{1+3}\\\color{white}{2+1}\end{bmatrix}=
  \begin{bmatrix}\color{white}{4}\\\color{white}{3}\end{bmatrix}$$`

# Vector Addition and Data
  
- Vector addition can be meaningful for data.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- If I *add* a cage with 1 chicken and 3 rabbits to another cage with 2 chickens and 1 rabbits what do I get?&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + A cage with 3 chickens and 4 rabbits.
---
  
# Vector Addition and Data
  
- Suppose Australia had a trade deficit of $US1bn in 2016 and $US3bn in 2017 and New Zealand had a trade deficit of $US2bn in 2016 and $US1bn in 2017.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Australia and New Zealand merge to form a currency union and the trade deficit statistics need to be updated.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + The new currency union had a trade deficit of $US3bn in 2016 and $US4bn in 2017.


---
  
# Scalar multiplication
  
- If we add a number `\(c\)` times we call that *multiplication*&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- We do something similar with vectors.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- If we add a vector to itself `\(c\)` times this is called *scalar multiplication*.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- We are multiplying a vector by a single number and NOT by another vector.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- This is very different from *matrix multiplication*.

---
  
# Scalar multiplication and data
  
- How might scalar multiplication be relevant to data?&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Suppose trade deficit is measured in Chinese Yuan instead of $US where 6 
Yuan = $US1.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Then we can get the trade defcit in Yuan by multiplying by the scalar 6.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Suppose Australia had a trade deficit of $US1bn in 2016 
and $US3bn in 2017.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + This is equivalent to a trade deficit of 6bn Yuan in 2016 and 18bn Yuan in 2017.

---
  
# Basis vector
  
-  Every vector can be created using&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + Scalar multiplication 
  + Vector addition 
  + Two *basis* vectors&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- The basis vectors we use are:
  
`$${\mathbf{b}}_1=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\quad\mbox{and}\quad{\mathbf{b}}_2=\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}$$`
  
---
  
# How the basis works
  
- Suppose we want the vector `\(\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}\)`
- This is given by

`$$x\mathbf{b}_1+y\mathbf{b}_2$$`
  or
`$$x\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}+y\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}$$`

# Matrices

---
  
# Matrices
  
- You have learnt about matrices before as an array of numbers.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Today think about matrices as *transforming* points in space.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- By multiplying a vector by a matrix, points in space are stetched, rotated and flipped around&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- But what does this have to do with an array of numbers?
  
---
  
# Example of a matrix
  
- Consider the following matrix
`$$\mathbf{M}=\begin{bmatrix}5 &amp;1\\2 &amp;4\end{bmatrix}$$`
- Think of this as something that moves all the points in space to a new address.
- It encodes where `\(\mathbf{b}_1\)` and `\(\mathbf{b}_2\)` get moved to.

---
  
# Change of basis 
  
Multiplying by the matrix `\(\mathbf{M}=\begin{bmatrix}{\color{magenta} 5} &amp;\color{green}{1}\\{\color{magenta} 2} &amp;{\color{green}4}\end{bmatrix}\)` will: 
  
Move the vector `\(\mathbf{b}_1=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\)` to `\(\mathbf{b}^{*}_1=\begin{bmatrix}{\color{magenta} 5}\\{\color{magenta} 2}\end{bmatrix}\)`
  
Move the vector `\(\mathbf{b}_2=\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\)` to `\(\mathbf{b}^{*}_2=\begin{bmatrix}{\color{green}  1}\\{\color{green} 4}\end{bmatrix}\)`
  
Matrix multiplication is a very different type of multiplication than scalar multiplication.

---
  
# Change of basis 
  
&lt;img src="MatrixGeometry_files/figure-html/basischange-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
  
#Old Basis
  
`$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{v}&amp;=x\mathbf{b}_1+y\mathbf{b}_2\\
&amp;=x\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}+y\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\\
&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}$$`
  
---
  
# New Basis
  
`$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{v}^*&amp;=x\mathbf{b}^{*}_1+y\mathbf{b}^{*}_2\\
&amp;=x\begin{bmatrix}5\\2\end{bmatrix}+y\begin{bmatrix}1\\4\end{bmatrix}\\
&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}5x+y\\2x+4y\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}$$`
  
---
  
# In general
  
Multiplying by the matrix `\(\mathbf{M}\)` moves all vectors `\(\mathbf{v}\)` to `\(\mathbf{v}^*\)`
  
We can write this as:
  
`$$\mathbf{v}^*=\mathbf{Mv}=\begin{bmatrix}5 &amp;1\\2 &amp;4\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}5x+y\\2x+4y\end{bmatrix}$$`
  
Another way to think of it is as multiplying the rows of `\({\mathbf M}\)` by the column `\(\mathbf {v}\)`

# Matrix Multiplication and Data
  
An simple application of matrix multiplication is to create *new* variables.

- Suppose we want a matrix to transform :
  + The number of chickens and number of rabbits to...&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + The number of heads and the number of feet.

---

# Answer

- First basis vector is the number of heads and feet of each chicken.
- Second basis vector is the number of heads and feet of each rabbit.

`$$\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;1\\2&amp;4\end{bmatrix}$$`
  
---

# Another one
  
- Suppose we want a matrix to transform:
  + The trade deficit in 2016 and trade deficit in 2017 to...&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + The average trade deficit from 2016 to 2017 and the change in the trade deficit between 2016 and 2017&lt;!--D--&gt;
--


What does this matrix look like?  Try yourselves.

---

# Answer

- First basis vector average and change if trade deficit was $1 in 2016 
and $0 in 2017.
- Second basis vector average and change if trade deficit was $0 in 2016 
and $1 in 2017.

`$$\begin{bmatrix}0.5&amp;0.5\\-1&amp;1\end{bmatrix}$$`

# Non-Square Matrices
  
- So far we have only considered `\(2\times 2\)` matrices.
- These move every point in 2D space to another point in 2D space
- However we can have a matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns (or `\(3\times2\)` matrix).

`$$\mathbf{M}=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp;2\\3 &amp;4\\5 &amp;6\\\end{bmatrix}$$`
  
---
  
# Non-square Matrices
  
`$$\begin{aligned}\mathbf{Mz}&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp;2\\3 &amp;4\\5 &amp;6\\\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}\\&amp;=x\begin{bmatrix}1\\3\\5\end{bmatrix}+y\begin{bmatrix}2\\4\\6\end{bmatrix}\\&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}x+2y\\3x+4y\\5x+6y\\\end{bmatrix}\end{aligned}$$`
  
---
  
# Non-square matrices
  
- Matrix multiplication works in the same way&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- However the *input* is a 2-dimensional vector but the *output* is a 3-dimensional vector&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Multiplying by a non-square matrix changes the dimension
--

- The points will still lie in a two-dimensional *subspace* of three-dimensional space.
---

# In factor analysis

- For an example of this consider the factor model and in particular the component `\(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\boldsymbol{f}_i\)`.
--

- This takes a low-dimensional set of factors and maps them to a high-dimensional vector of data.
--

- What about multiplying by a `\(2\times 3\)` matrix?

---
  
  
# Dimension reduction

- Multiplying by a `\(2\times 3\)` matrix takes a `\(3\)`-dimensional vector and maps it to a point in `\(2\)`-dimensional space.
--

- This is an example of *dimension reduction*
--

- For instance taking the first two principal component of data is the same as multiplying the data by a `\(2\times p\)` matrix

---

# Matrix composition
  
- What does it mean to multiply matrices?  
--

- What does `\(\mathbf{F}\mathbf{G}\)` when `\(\mathbf{G}\)` is a `\(4\times 2\)` matrix and `\(\mathbf{F}\)` a `\(3\times 4\)` matrix?
--

- It is as a *composition* of transformations:&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + Transform a `\(2\)`-dimensional vector `\(\mathbf{v}\)` into a `\(4\)`-dimensional vector by multiplying by the `\(4\times 2\)` matrix `\(\mathbf{G}\)`&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

  + Transorm the result into a `\(3\)`-dimensional vector by multiplying by a `\(3\times 4\)` matrix `\(\mathbf{F}\)`
  
---
  
# Mathematically
  
- When reading below go from right to left:
  
`$$\underset{{ (3\times 2)}}{\mathbf{H}}
\underset{{ \leftarrow}}{\times}
\underset{{ (2\times 1)}}{\mathbf{v}}
\underset{=}{{ =}}
\underset{{ (3\times 4)}}{\mathbf{F}}
\underset{{ \leftarrow}}{\times}
\underset{{ (4\times 2)}}{\mathbf{G}}
\underset{{ \leftarrow}}{\times}
\underset{{ (2\times 1)}}{\mathbf{v}}$$`
  
- The matrix `\(\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{FG}\)` is a composition of doing `\(\mathbf{G}\)` and then `\(\mathbf{F}\)` 
  
---
  
# Matrix multiplication
  
- What happens if you try to multiply `\(\mathbf{GFv}\)`?&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

`$$\underset{{ (4\times 2)}}{\mathbf{G}}\underset{{ \not\leftarrow}}{\times}\underset{{ (3\times 4)}}{\mathbf{F}}\underset{{ \not\leftarrow}}{\times}\underset{{ (2\times 1)}}{\mathbf{v}}$$`&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Going from right to left, `\(\mathbf{F}\)` will try to transform a 4-dimensional vector to a 3-dimensional vector and cannot take the is a 2-dimensional vector `\(\mathbf{v}\)`  as its input!&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Also `\(\mathbf{G}\)` transforms a 2-dimensional vector to a 4-dimensional vector so cannot take the 3-dimensional output of `\(\mathbf{F}\)` as its input.

---
  
# Matrix Multiplication
  
- Although it is possible to get `\(\mathbf{FG}\)` it is impossible to get `\(\mathbf{GF}\)`.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- In general, for matrix multiplication `\(\mathbf{AB}\neq\mathbf{BA}\)` even for square matrices.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- Matrix multiplication is *non-commutative*.

# Inner products and rotations

---

# Inner product

- One final operation with vectors is called the *inner product*.
--

- The inner product of two vectors `\(\mathbf{x}\)` and `\(\mathbf{y}\)` is defined as `\(\mathbf{x}'\mathbf{y}\)`.
--

- The inner product of a vector with itself `\(\mathbf{x}'\mathbf{x}\)` is the length of the vector squared. 
  
---
# Orthogonality

- An interesting case is when the inner product between two vectors is zero.
  - `\(\mathbf{x}'\mathbf{y}=0\)`
- In this case, the vectors `\(\mathbf{x}\)` and `\(\mathbf{y}\)` are at a 90 degree angle to one another.
- This is also called *orthogonality*.

---
# Rotation matrix
  
- Another important matrix is known as a *orthogonal rotation* matrix.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- It spins all the points around keeping them the same distance from the origin and from each other.&lt;!--D--&gt;
--

- The word *orthogonal* means that the new basis vectors are at right angles to one another.

---
  
# Rotation Matrix

- In matrix algebra rotation can be defined in any dimension.
- It is easiest to understand in two dimensions.
- An example of a rotation matrix in two dimensions is:
`$$\mathbf{R}=\begin{bmatrix}0.8 &amp; -0.6\\0.6 &amp; 0.8\end{bmatrix}$$`


---

#Rotation Matrix

&lt;video controls&gt;&lt;source src="MatrixGeometry_files/figure-html/matmultr.ogg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

---
  
# Rotation matrix
  
- The new basis vectors should have a length of 1 therefore `\(\mathbf{r}_i'\mathbf{r}_i=1\)` where `\(\mathbf{r}_i\)` are the columns of `\(\mathbf{R}\)`.
--

- The new basis vectors should be at right angles `\(\mathbf{r}_i'\mathbf{r}_j=0\)`
--

- A rotation matrix `\(\mathbf{R}\)` has the property `\(\mathbf{R'R}=\mathbf{I}\)`&lt;!--D--&gt;

---

# Rotations in PCA

- In PCA the weights of the principal components have two properties
  - `\(\mathbf{w}_i'\mathbf{w}_i=1\)`
  - `\(\mathbf{w}_i'\mathbf{w}_j=0\)`
- All `\(p\)` principal components can be obtained by multiplying by a rotation matrix by `\(p\)`-dimensional data.
- Taking principal components *rotates* the data.

---

# Rotations in Factor Analysis

- In factor analysis rotation was used to obtain more interpretable factors.
- This was a `\(r\)`-dimensional rotation of the factors rather than the data.
- Again this involved multiplying by a rotation matrix.

---

# Conclusion

- Understand the geometry of matrix algebra assists in understanding PCA and Factor analysis in particular.
- PCA forms new variables as linear combinations of old variables.
  - This corresponds to matrix multiplication.
- The role of *rotation* should now also be understood.
- The next step is to understand the importance of matrix decompositions in the methods covered so far.
