# Basics



---


# The R project

- In this unit we use the software package R.
--

- R is one of the the most popular software tool for professionals in the fields of Business Analytics/Data Science.

---

# History of R

- R is based on earlier statistical software called 'S' which was developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s.
--

- R was initially developed in the early 1990s by two academics at the University of Auckland, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentlemen. 
--

- R has grown substantially since then and is now supported the not-for-profit R Foundation

---

# R is Free Software

- R is free in two ways
  - It doesn't cost any money.
  - All of the source code of R is available meaning R can be customised, modified, and most importantly extended.
- R is part of a big Free Software project known as the GNU Project

---

# Downloading R and R Studio

- R can be downloaded [here](http://cloud.r-project.org/)
--

- Exact details of installing R will depend on whether you use Windows, Mac or Linux.
--

- A great tool for both new and experienced users of R is *RStudio*.
--

- It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) free of cost.
--

- If you haven't done so already try to download R and R Studio.

---

# Ways to use R

- To keep track of your workflow use a **script**:
  - Open a new script by typing Ctrl+Shift+N
  - Run a single line of code by pressing Ctrl+Enter
  - Run a whole script by pressing Ctrl+Shift+S or Ctrl+Shift+Enter
- You can save scripts to run them anytime.
--

- Scripts allow you to keep analysis **replicable** which is important in research and business.

---

# Variables in R

- In R everything is stored in a **variable**. 
--

- Here the word variable has a slightly different meaning to the usual statistical meaning. 
--

- In R, think of these as little boxes with names on them.
--

- We can put a number into these boxes, or words or matrices or entire blocks of data or even other boxes.

---

# Assigning Variables

- How to store the number 1 in a variable `a` and the number 2 in a variable `b`?

```r
a&lt;-1
b=2
```
- Note that you can use either `&lt;-` or `=` to assign variables. 

---

# Seeing results

To see what is stored in a variable


```r
print(b)
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
str(b)
```

```
##  num 2
```

---

# Character variables

- Text can also be stored in a variable.  
- Try to store your own name in a variable called *name*.

```r
name&lt;-'Anastasios'
str(name)
```

```
##  chr "Anastasios"
```
- Use apostrophes so that R does not look for a variable called `Anastasios`.

---

# Variable Names

- Variable names can include letters, digits, the full stop `.` and the underscore `_`
- The variable name cannot begin with a number or underscore.
- They can begin with a full stop but only if the second digit is a letter.
- For more details type `?make.names` into your R console

---

# Valid and Invalid

- Valid:
  - `FirstName`
  - `First.Name`
  - `First_Name`
  - `.FirstName`
- Invalid:
  - `1stName`
  - `.1stName`
  - `_First.Name`
  - `First Name`
  - `FirstName?`
---

#Foreign Languages

- R has support for foreign languages, but the same rules apply
- Valid:
  - `Όνομα`
  - `название`
  - `名字`
  - `이름`
- Invalid:
  - `1Όνομα`
  - `.название`
  - `名 字`

---

# Case Sensitivity

- R is case sensitive.
- This means that the following are all different:
  - `Name` 
  - `name`
  - `NAME`
  - `nAMe`

---

# Workspace

- All variables are kept in the **workspace**.  You can see what is in your workspace by using the command


```r
ls()
```

```
## [1] "a"    "b"    "name"
```


---

# Clear Workspace

- You can clear the workspace using


```r
rm(list=ls())
```
- If you try ls() again the workspace will be empty.  In RStudio you  can also see all the variables in the *Environment* tab.
--

- It is good practice to start every script with this command so that you do not accidentally use data from a different project.

---

# Working directory

- If you read data stored on your computer, or if you save plots or data then the concept of a **working directory** is important.  
--

- To check your working directory type


```r
getwd()
```

- To change the Working directory use `setwd` 


```r
setwd("/home/anastasios/Documents")
```

---

# Basic arithmetic in R

- Basic arithmetic is fairly simple.  Try `a+b`.  Also we will put this in a new variable called `z`.


```r
z&lt;-a+b
str(z)
```

```
##  num 3
```

- To subtract use `-`, to multiply use `*`, to divide `/` and to take powers use `^`.

---

# Functions in R

- Apart from very simple arithmetic, variables in R are manipulated using a **function**.  
--

- The input goes in parentheses, while the output is assigned to a new variable.  
--

- For example the function *sqrt* is used to take the square root.  


```r
rootb&lt;-sqrt(b)
str(rootb)
```

```
##  num 1.41
```

---

#Garbage in/Garbage out

What happens when you take a square root of something that is not a number?


```r
rootname&lt;-sqrt(name)
```

```
## Error in sqrt(name): non-numeric argument to mathematical function
```

Many if not most of the mistakes you make in R occur because you enter the incorrect type of input in a function.
---

# Getting Help

- If you aren't sure what a function does, use R help.  The easiest way is to simply use the `?`


```r
?sqrt
```

- If you want to do something and do not know the name of the relevant function you can search using `??`.  
--

- Find a function to do logarithms using


```r
??logarithms
```

---

# Comments

Anything after a `#` will not be executed by R.

```r
a&lt;-1 # Set the variable a to 1
#x&lt;-4 This line is not executed 
str(a)
```

```
##  num 1
```

```r
str(x)
```

```
## Error in str(x): object 'x' not found
```
Comment multiple lines using Ctrl+Shift+C

---

# Vectors

In stats we have many observations for each variable.  The function `c()` stores these in a **vector**. Suppose we have the following data:

Names  | Drink | Consumption | Satisfaction
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Andrew  | Coke | 50 | 5
Boris  | Pepsi | 40 | 4
Cathy  | Coke | 25 | 4
Diana  | 7Up | 0 | 3


---

# Manually inputting data

First let's create the variable Consumption

```r
Consumption&lt;-c(50,40,25,0)
print(Consumption)
```

```
## [1] 50 40 25  0
```

```r
str(Consumption)
```

```
##  num [1:4] 50 40 25 0
```

Put values of drink into a variable.

---

# Solution

The solution is

```r
Drink&lt;-c('Coke','Pepsi','Coke','7Up')
print(Drink)
```

```
## [1] "Coke"  "Pepsi" "Coke"  "7Up"
```

```r
str(Drink)
```

```
##  chr [1:4] "Coke" "Pepsi" "Coke" "7Up"
```

---

# Vector

These variables are example of a **vector**.  Sometimes when we apply a function to a vector, we apply the function to each element.


```r
logcons&lt;-log(Consumption)
str(logcons)
```

```
##  num [1:4] 3.91 3.69 3.22 -Inf
```


---

# Vectors

Other functions take a vector as an input and return a single number as the output


```r
meancons&lt;-mean(Consumption)
str(meancons)
```

```
##  num 28.8
```

---

# Inf and NaN

The values `Inf` and `-Inf` refer to positive and negative infinity.  The value `NaN` stands for not a number and indicates an error.


```r
log(-1)
```

```
## Warning in log(-1): NaNs produced
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

It is important to distinguish `NaN` from `NA`. The latter is used for missing data.

---

# Data Frame

- It is tedious to manually enter large datasets in this way.  You will usually import data from an external file.
--

- There are many ways to import data.  For files with the `.rds` extension it is easy


```r
Beer&lt;-readRDS("Beer.rds")
```

- Get the location of the file right.  You can also open a file through the *file* tab

---

# Data Frame

- There is only one variable here, the variable *Beer*.  However this is a very special case of variable known as a **Data Frame**.
--

- A data frame contains other variables.  For example *alcohol* content can be accessed via.


```r
str(Beer$alcohol)
```

```
##  num [1:35] 3.7 4.1 4.2 4.3 2.9 2.3 4.2 4.7 5.5 4.7 ...
```

---

# Lists

Another object common in R is known as a **list**.  A list can contain completely different variables.

```r
alist&lt;-list(w=name, x=Drink, y=Beer)
```
elements of lists are accessed using `[[]]` or `$`

```r
alist[[1]]
```

```
## [1] "Anastasios"
```

# Packages

---

# R Packages

- One of the biggest advantages of R is the use of add-on packages, which are are easily downloaded from an online repository called **CRAN**.  Using a package involves two steps:
--

  - Downloading and installing the package using the function `install.package`.
  - Load the package using `library` function
--

- Both these steps can also be done in RStudio through the *Packages* tab.
--

- Try install and load the R package `ggplot2`

---

# Package Documentation

- By downloading the package you also download all of the help documentation.


```r
install.packages('ggplot2')
```
To load the package

```r
library(ggplot2)
```

---

# Graphics in R

- Three different ways to do graphs in R
  - Base graphics do not require any packages
  - Trellis graphics (using package lattice)
  - ggplot2
--

- In this unit you will mostly be given instruction on using `ggplot2`, however if you have learnt base graphics in another unit and prefer this, then you can use it.
--

- There are many resources for learning `ggplot2`, including some that are free online.

---

# MT cars dataset

To demonstrate `ggplot2` we use the dataset `mpg`, which contains information on the fuel efficiency of different cars.  This can be loaded into R using the command


```r
data(mpg)
```

It is data that comes together with `ggplot2`.

---

# ggplot object

- To make a plot, the first task is to create a ggplot object.  
--

- You need to specify the data frame and the **aesthetic**.  
--

- In a 2D plot we can compare two variables
--

- To start, think of the aesthetic as the x and y variable.
--

- Consider a plot to compare the fuel efficiency of a car in the city and on the highway.

---

# Number of Cylinders v MPG


```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=cty,y=hwy))
```

&lt;img src="R_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Geometry

- This should produce some axes and labels but there is no plot yet.
--

- To produce a plot we need to tell R what type of plot we want.
--

- In the language of ggplot this is called a **geometry**
--

- For a scatter plot the geometry is `geom_point()`.

---

# Scatterplot in R


```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=cty,y=hwy))+geom_point()
```

&lt;img src="R_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Other aesthetics

We can think of colour as a third aesthetic


```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=cty,y=hwy,col=cyl))+geom_point()
```

&lt;img src="R_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# With a categorical variable


```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=cty,y=hwy,col=drv))+geom_point()
```

&lt;img src="R_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Quicker plots

A useful function in `ggplot2` is to use `qplot` which will try to guess the plot you want.  Try these examples  


```r
qplot(x=cty,y=hwy,data=mpg)
qplot(x=cty,data=mpg)
```

---

# Exporting graphics

- You can export graphics using the *Export* tab in the *Plot* tab in Rstudio.  
--

- Many different file formats are available. As an alternative you can do the following:


```r
pdf('myplot.pdf')
qplot(x=cty,data=mpg)
dev.off()
```

- Other file formats such an png or jpeg can be used instead of pdf.

---

# Data Manipulation

- There are several ways to manipulate data, but a particularly useful and easy package to use is called **dplyr**.
--

- We can exclude observations using the `filter` function.
--

- To really understand how to use this function it helps to know about **logical operators** (try `?Logic`) and **relational operators** (try `?Comparison`).
--

- We will do a few simple examples here

---

# Using dplyr

To create a new data frame that only includes 4 wheel drives


```r
library(dplyr)
mpg_4wd&lt;-filter(mpg,drv=='4')
```

To exclude all 4 wheel drives


```r
mpg_no4wd&lt;-filter(mpg,drv!='4')
```

---

# Two conditions

Suppose we only want to consider cars that are 4 wheel drives **and** can drive more than 15 miles per gallon on the highway


```r
mpg_4wd_hwyg15&lt;-filter(mpg,(drv=='4')&amp;(hwy&gt;15))
```

Or those that are either 4 wheel drives **or** can drive less than 15 miles per gallon in the city


```r
mpg_4wd_ctyl15&lt;-filter(mpg,(drv=='4')|(cty&lt;15))
```

---

# Without dplyr

- This sort of data manipulation can be done without `dplyr` but is more verbose.  
- For example the last line would be

```r
mpg_4wd_ctyl15&lt;-mpg[((mpg$drv=='4')|(mpg$cty&lt;15)),]
```
- Both give the same result, use whichever you prefer.

---

# Summarise Fuction

- Suppose we want the mean and standard deviation of the (filtered) data.


```r
mpg_4wd_ctyl15&lt;-filter(mpg,(drv=='4')|(cty&lt;15))
mean_sd_hwy&lt;-summarise(mpg_4wd_ctyl15,mean(hwy),sd(hwy))
mean_sd_hwy
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   `mean(hwy)` `sd(hwy)`
##         &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1          19      3.91
```


---

# Pipes

- Pipes from the *magrittr* package make this easier.


```r
filter(mpg,(drv=='4')|(cty&lt;15))%&gt;%
  summarise(mean(hwy),sd(hwy))%&gt;%
  print
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   `mean(hwy)` `sd(hwy)`
##         &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1          19      3.91
```


---

# Conclusion

- This lecture has given you a foundation in R
--

- You can use R to do much more including collecting data off the web, cleaning the data, fitting models to the data, creating web applications, or even creating documents (these slides were created in RStudio).
--

- This can be daunting, but remember the best thing about R is that there are lots of ways to teach yourself R.
